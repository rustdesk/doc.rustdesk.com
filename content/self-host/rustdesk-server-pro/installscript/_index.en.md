### Backup/Restore

To make life easy we have created a backup and restore script, this will take the keys, all configuration and database and create a tar file which can be saved to else where.

To setup the backup script on your RustDesk Server do the following:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rustdesk/rustdesk-server-pro/main/backup.sh
chmod +x backup.sh
```
You now have options.

Run the backup script `./backup.sh` to create a one time backup.

Or run the backup script `./backup.sh --schedule`. This will schedule the backup script to run nightly and autorotate.

To restore do the following:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rustdesk/rustdesk-server-pro/main/restore.sh
chmod +x restore.sh
```
Copy the backup file into the same folder as the restore.sh file and then run `./restore.sh`.

This will restore your server to how it was prior, you will need to revoke your [license](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/self-host/rustdesk-server-pro/license/) to move it to the restored server.
