### I installed with the script, how can I start and stop services?
The services use systemd so can be started and stopped using `sudo systemctl stop|start|restart rustdesk-hbbs|rustdesk-hbbr` e.g. `sudo systemctl restart rustdesk-hbbs`.

### I installed with the script, how can I view the Linux logs?
The logs are stored in `/var/log/rustdesk-server`, you can view them using `tail /var/log/rustdesk-server/hbbs.log` or `tail /var/log/rustdesk-server/hbbs.error`.

### I installed with the script, how can I check the status of the RustDesk services?
To check the status `sudo systemctl status rustdesk-hbbs|rustdesk-hbbr` e.g. `sudo systemctl status rustdesk-hbbs`.

### How can I change the admin password?
1. Go to `https://rustdesk.yourdomain.com` or `http://youripaddress:21114`.
2. Log in with the username `admin` and password `test1234`.
3. Click on `admin` in the top right hand corner.
4. Click on `Settings`.
5. Enter your new password in the boxes provided.

### How can I move my license to a new server?
Please see [here](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/self-host/rustdesk-server-pro/license/#invoices-and-migration).

### Emails aren't working from my VPS
A lot of VPS providers block ports 465 and 25.

A simple way to check is using telnet. To test in the Linux terminal type `telnet your.mailserver.com 25`. On Windows use PowerShell with `Test-NetConnection -ComputerName your.mailserver.com -Port 25`.

Your mail server may not be using port 25. Please make sure you are using the correct ports.

### Can I deploy RustDesk using PowerShell or similar?
Sure, you can find scripts to aid deployment [here](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/self-host/client-deployment/).

### I have installed RustDesk Server Pro manually but the API web console isn't behind SSL, how can I secure this?
Use a proxy like Nginx, the simple install script has one, it's really simple. [This is how we do it](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk-server-pro/blob/493ad90daf8815c3052ff4d0d4aa9cc07e411efa/install.sh#L252).

Similar configs should work with Traefik v2, HAProxy, Apache Proxy and Cloudflare Tunnel.

### How can I file a bug report?
Please file via [GitHub](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk-server-pro/issues).

### Why if I am self hosting is this not free and open source?
1. RustDesk has become a full time job for a number of people, they have lives, wives, jobs and kids which all demands attention and costs money!
2. We want to be here and still making great progress in years to come.
3. The open source version will continue to be open source and we encourage others to make developments in line with the AGPL license.

### I can't connect to devices in different groups, why is this?
This is easily sorted, you need to allow cross-group access.
1. Add new groups.
2. Click `Edit`.
3. Select the relevant groups you want access (it automatically adds them in the corresponding group).

### How can I get configs automatically?
Configs are generated automatically.
1. Download the newest clients from [GitHub](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/releases/latest).
2. On the main page in the web console click on `Windows EXE`.
3. Fill in the host and API (if different from your config).
4. Click `Submit`.
5. Scan QR Code on Android and rename exe to what has been generated.

### Do you offer hosting for RustDesk Server Pro?
Please get in touch with our [sales](mailto://sales@rustdesk.com) team.

### Is there somewhere I can see video setup guides?
Yes! We have a [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@RustDesk).

### Why are my logs are empty?
Ensure API is set on both the device being controlled and the machine controlling.
On the left hand side click on `Logs`.

### How can I uninstall RustDesk Server Pro?
Run the following commands:
```sh
sudo systemctl stop rustdesk-hbbs.service
sudo systemctl disable rustdesk-hbbs.service
sudo systemctl stop rustdesk-hbbr.service
sudo systemctl disable rustdesk-hbbr.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/rustdesk-hbbs.service
sudo rm etc/systemd/system/rustdesk-hbbr.service
sudo rm /usr/bin/hbbs
sudo rm /usr/bin/hbbr
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/rustdesk-server/
sudo rm -rf /var/log/rustdesk-server/
```
If the script installed Nginx then remove using:
```sh
sudo apt remove nginx
```

### How can I remove devices from the device list in the web console?
Disable and then delete will now be available.

### How can I update RustDesk with PowerShell?
```ps
$ErrorActionPreference= 'silentlycontinue'

$rdver = ((Get-ItemProperty  "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\RustDesk\").Version)

if ($rdver -eq "1.2.3")
{
    Write-Output "RustDesk $rdver is the newest version."
    Exit
}

if (!(Test-Path C:\Temp))
{
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path C:\Temp > null
}

cd C:\Temp

Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/releases/download/1.2.3/rustdesk-1.2.3-x86_64.exe" -Outfile "rustdesk.exe"
Start-Process .\rustdesk.exe --silent-install -wait
```

### `Key mismatch` error
Please configure your client with [correct key](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/self-host/rustdesk-server-pro/relay/).

### `Failed to connect to relay server` error
Please make sure `hbbr` is running. More information about `hbbr`, you can find [here](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/self-host/rustdesk-server-oss/install/).
If your `hbbr` does not run on the same machine of `hbbs`, or you have multiple relay servers, or you do not run it on default port `21117`, you have to tell it to `hbbs` explicitly. Please check [here](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/self-host/rustdesk-server-pro/relay/).

### Set up HTTPS for web console manually

#### 1. Buy a domain name and resolve it to your server's IP address.
* Buy a domain name from a domain registrar like GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Namesilo.
* Resolve the domain name to your server's IP address with one of the following:
    - Your domain registrar's control panel (recommended)
    - [DNS providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_managed_DNS_providers)

For example, if you buy a domain name `example.com` from `Namesilo` and your server's IP address is `123.123.123.123`, you want to use `rustdesk.example.com` subdomain as your HTTPS web console address. You need to open [link](https://www.namesilo.com/account_domains.php), click the button with tooltip `Manage dns for the domain`, add add a `A` record with the hostname name `rustdesk` and the IP address of your server.
![](/docs/en/self-host/rustdesk-server-pro/faq/images/namesilo-dns-button.png)
![](/docs/en/self-host/rustdesk-server-pro/faq/images/namesilo-add-a-record.png)
![](/docs/en/self-host/rustdesk-server-pro/faq/images/namesilo-dns-table.png)
* It takes some time for DNS to take effect, go to https://www.whatsmydns.net and check whether the domain name has been resolved to your server's IP address. Step 6 depends on the correct resolve result. In the following steps, replace `<YOUR_DOMAIN>` with your subdomain, e.g. `rustdesk.example.com`.

#### 2. Install Nginx
* Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install nginx`
* Fedora/CentOS: `sudo dnf install nginx` or `sudo yum install nginx`
* Arch: `sudo pacman -S install nginx`
* openSUSE: `sudo zypper install nginx`
* Gentoo: `sudo emerge -av nginx`
* Appine: `sudo apk add --no-cache nginx`

Run `nginx -h` to check whether it has been installed successfully.

#### 3. Install Certbot
* Method 1: If snap is installed, run `sudo snap install certbot --classic`
* Method 2: Using `python3-certbot-nginx` instead. e.g. `sudo apt-get install python3-certbot-nginx` for ubuntu
* Method 3: If the above two methods failed, try install `certbot-nginx`, e.g. `sudo yum install certbot-nginx` for centos 7

Run `certbot -h` to check whether it has been installed successfully..

#### 4. Config Nginx
There are two ways:
* If directory `/etc/nginx/sites-available` and `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` exists, replace `<YOUR_DOMAIN>` of the following command with your domain name and run it.
```sh
cat > /etc/nginx/sites-available/rustdesk.conf << EOF
server {
server_name <YOUR_DOMAIN>;
    location / {
        proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP       \$remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For \$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:21114/;
    }
}
EOF
```
Then run `sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/rustdesk.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/rustdesk.conf`.

Run `cat /etc/nginx/sites-available/rustdesk.conf` to make sure its content is correct.

* If directory `/etc/nginx/sites-available` and `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` don't exist and directory `/etc/nginx/conf.d` exists, replace `<YOUR_DOMAIN>` of the following command with your domain name and run it.
```sh
cat > /etc/nginx/conf.d/rustdesk.conf << EOF
server {
server_name <YOUR_DOMAIN>;
    location / {
        proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP       \$remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For \$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:21114/;
    }
}
EOF
```
Run `cat /etc/nginx/conf.d/rustdesk.conf` to make sure its content is correct.

#### 5. Enable firewall rules for the domain
Run the following commands:

```sh
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw --force enable
sudo ufw --force reload
```

#### 6. Generate SSL certificate
Replace `<YOUR_DOMAIN>` with your domain name, then run
`sudo certbot --nginx --cert-name <YOUR_DOMAIN> --key-type ecdsa --renew-by-default --no-eff-email --agree-tos --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory -d <YOUR_DOMAIN>`.

If it prompts `Enter email address (used for urgent renewal and security notices)`, enter your email address.

Finally, the content of `rustdesk.conf` should be like this:
```
server {
server_name <YOUR_DOMAIN>;
    location / {
        proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP       $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:21114/;
    }

    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/<YOUR_DOMAIN>/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/<YOUR_DOMAIN>/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}
server {
    if ($host = <YOUR_DOMAIN>) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot

server_name <YOUR_DOMAIN>;
    listen 80;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot

}
```

Here are some common errors:

* The console prints `Successfully deployed certificate for <YOUR_DOMAIN> to /etc/nginx/.../default`  rather than `Successfully deployed certificate for <YOUR_DOMAIN> to /etc/nginx/.../rustdesk.conf`.

The reason may be Certbot doesn't find the `rustdesk.conf` file, you can try one of the following solutions:
- Check the result of the step 5, run `sudo service nginx restart`.
- Copy the server configs `server{...}` which contain `<YOUR_DOMAIN>` to `rustdesk.conf`, and change `location{...}` to the content below.

```sh
location / {
           proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP       \$remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For \$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:21114/;
      }
```

* `too many certificates (5) already issued for this exact set of domains in the last 168 hours`

Solution: Add another domain name to DNS and change `<YOUR_DOMAIN>` to it, e.g. `rustdesk2.example.com`. Then repeat step 1, 4, 6.

* `Error getting validation data`

Solution: it may be caused by firewall, please refer to https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/self-host/rustdesk-server-pro/faq/#firewall

Notice: Run `sudo service nginx restart` if you change the `rustdesk.conf` manually.

#### 7. Login to the web page
* Open https://<YOUR_DOMAIN> in the browser, log in using the default user name "admin" and password "test1234", then change the password to your own.

### SELinux

If `Waiting for RustDesk Relay service to become active...` appears when install, it may be caused by SELinux. You can try the following commands:

```sh
sudo semanage fcontext -a -t NetworkManager_dispatcher_exec_t 'hbbs'
sudo semanage fcontext -a -t NetworkManager_dispatcher_exec_t 'hbbr'
sudo restorecon -v '/usr/bin/hbbs'
sudo restorecon -v '/usr/bin/hbbr'
```

### Firewall

#### Firewall of cloud
If you run on AWS/Azure/Google/DigitalOcean cloud, please open UDP (21116) and TCP (21114-21119) inbound port on cloud vendor's dashboard.

- [AWS] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html
- [Azure] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview
- [Google] https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/firewalls
- [DigitalOcean] https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/firewalls/

#### Firewall of on-premise server
RustDesk set firewall with `ufw`. It may not work on some distros like CentOS 9, you can try with `firewall-cmd`:

```sh
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=21115/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=21116/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=21117/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=21118/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=21119/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=21116/udp
```

If you use IP:

```sh
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=21114/tcp
```

If you use DNS/Domain:

```sh
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp
```

After above, run `sudo firewall-cmd --reload` to reload firewall.
