Non-administrator users can also login to browse their device and logs, change their user settings.

### Automatic Configs
By Clicking on `Windows EXE` you will be able to get the configs for your own RustDesk Server Pro, this will help configure your clients.

For Windows clients, you can leave out the custom server configuration and put the configuration information in the `rustdesk.exe` filename instead. As shown above, please go to the console welcome page and click on `Windows EXE`. **Client ≥ 1.1.9 required.**

You can use this in conjunction with [client config](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/self-host/client-configuration/) and [deployment scripts](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/self-host/client-deployment/) to setup your clients.

### Assign Device Users/Groups/Strategies to Devices
The User is the RustDesk User logged in on the device or assigned to the device by clicking `Edit` next to the device, click in the `User` box and drop-down to select your user, this will auto assign the group based on the group the user as been assigned to.

This can also be done via the API at command line on deployment or later by calling the RustDesk executable followed by `--assign --token <generatedtoken> --user_name <username>`. You need to go to `Settings → Tokens → Create` and create a token with Device permissions first to do this. An example of this on windows would be `"C:\Program Files\RustDesk\rustdesk.exe" --assign --token <generatedtoken> --user_name <newuser>`.

You can also assign strategy in this way, e.g. `--assign --token <generatedtoken> --strategy_name <strategyname>`.

The command line on Windows does not have output by default. To get output, please run like this, `"C:\Program Files\RustDesk\rustdesk.exe" <arg1> <arg2> ... | more` or `"C:\Program Files\RustDesk\rustdesk.exe" <arg1> <arg2> ... | Out-String`, see [here](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/discussions/6377#discussioncomment-8094952).

### Searching for a device
1. Go to Devices.
2. In the Device Name Search Field type in the name and click `Query` or hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
3. To use a wildcard add `%` at the start, end or both of the search term.
