### Install your own server with Docker

#### Requirements
You need to have Docker/Podman installed to run a rustdesk-server as a Docker container, if in doubt install Docker with this [guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) to ensure its the most up to date!

By default, `hbbs` listens on 21114 (TCP, for web console, only available in Pro version), 21115 (TCP), 21116 (TCP/UDP) and 21118 (TCP), `hbbr` listens on 21117 (TCP) and 21119 (TCP). Be sure to open these ports in the firewall. **Please note that 21116 should be enabled both for TCP and UDP.** 21115 is used for the NAT type test, 21116/UDP is used for the ID registration and heartbeat service, 21116/TCP is used for TCP hole punching and connection service, 21117 is used for the Relay services, and 21118 and 21119 are used to support web clients. *If you do not need web client (21118, 21119) support, the corresponding ports can be disabled.*

- TCP (**21114, 21115, 21116, 21117, 21118, 21119**)
- UDP (**21116**)

#### Docker examples

```sh
sudo docker image pull rustdesk/rustdesk-server
sudo docker run --name hbbs -v ./data:/root -td --net=host rustdesk/rustdesk-server hbbs -r <relay-server-ip[:port]>
sudo docker run --name hbbr -v ./data:/root -td --net=host rustdesk/rustdesk-server hbbr
```
<a name="net-host"></a>

{{% notice note %}}
`--net=host` only works on **Linux**, which makes `hbbs`/`hbbr` see the real incoming IP Address rather than the Container IP (172.17.0.1).
If `--net=host` works fine, the `-p` options are not used. If on Windows, leave out `sudo` and `--net=host`.

**Please remove `--net=host` if you are having connection problems on your platform.**

{{% notice note %}}
If you can not see logs with `-td`, you can see logs via `docker logs hbbs`. Or you can run with `-it`, `hbbs/hbbr` will not run as daemon mode.

#### Docker Compose examples
For running the Docker files with the `compose.yml` as described here you need to have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.

```yaml
services:
  hbbs:
    container_name: hbbs
    image: rustdesk/rustdesk-server:latest
    command: hbbs
    volumes:
      - ./data:/root
    network_mode: "host"

    depends_on:
      - hbbr
    restart: unless-stopped

  hbbr:
    container_name: hbbr
    image: rustdesk/rustdesk-server:latest
    command: hbbr
    volumes:
      - ./data:/root
    network_mode: "host"
    restart: unless-stopped
```
