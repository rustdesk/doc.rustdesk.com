### Configuring RustDesk
There is number of ways to configure RustDesk.

The easiest way is using RustDesk Server Pro you can obtain an encrypted config string, this can be used in conjunction with `--config` to import settings. To do this:
1. Open command line on whichever OS you use, to the folder where RustDesk is installed i.e. `C:\Program Files\RustDesk` on Windows, `/usr/bin` on Linux.
2. Use the command `rustdesk.exe --config your-encrypted-string` e.g. `rustdesk.exe --config 9JSPSvJzNrBDasJjNSdXOVVBlERDlleoNWZzIHcOJiOikXZr8mcw5yazVGZ0NXdy5CdyciojI0N3boJye`.

You can manually setup a client. To do this:
1. Click on Settings.
2. Click on Network.
3. Click Unlock Network Settings.
4. Enter your ID, Relay, API (if using pro server) and your key.

If you manually setup a client, you can retrieve the `RustDesk2.toml` (in the users folder) file and use `--import-config` in a similar way to the above example.

### Command Line Parameters
- `--password` can be used to set a permanent password.
- `--get-id` can be used to retrieve the ID.
- `--set-id` can be used to set an ID, please note IDs should start with a letter.
- `--silent-install` can be used to install RustDesk silently on Windows.

Additional Advanced parameters can be found [here](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/bdc5cded221af9697eb29aa30babce75e987fcc9/src/core_main.rs#L242).
